# Role::Enum

This is just a little experiment that grew from liking Object::Enum, but
prefering something more akin to defining types, with traditional numeric
backing values and sortability.  If it seems like a good idea, it may grow into
a proper dist later, with a DBIC inflate helper bundled in.
